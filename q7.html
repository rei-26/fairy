    <h1>💫 A Dream Shared</h1>

    <p>As dusk settles, you drift toward a moonlit clearing. Fireflies weave glowing trails around you, and the hush of the world feels like a lullaby.</p>

    <p>A voice, not quite of this world, whispers softly:</p>

    <p><em>“Share your dream. Just one — the truest wish from your fairy heart.”</em></p>

      <li><a href="q8.html">🌳 To explore beyond Pixie Hollow, into the great unknown. (Explorer, Air)</a></li>
      <li><a href="q8.html">💧 To help others heal and feel deeply. (Water, Nurturer)</a></li>
