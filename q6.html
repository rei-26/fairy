      Queen Clarion appears again, gliding down through soft beams of twilight. Her wings shimmer like distant stars, and her voice is gentle but resolute.</p>
    <p><em>“To truly discover your fairy path,”</em> she says, <em>“you must face the fear that lingers deepest in your heart.”</em></p>
    <p>The air stills. Even the wind listens.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you fear most?</strong></p>
     
    <div class="choices">
      <button onclick="saveAnswer('A');">👣 Letting others down — the thought of someone counting on you, and failing them, makes your wings tremble</button>
      <button onclick="saveAnswer('B');">🌟 Being ordinary or forgotten — you long to shine so brightly, the world remembers your name in song</button>
      <button onclick="saveAnswer('C');">💥 Breaking something important — the fragile things you care about, your creations, your friendships, what if you ruin them?</button>
      <button onclick="saveAnswer('D');">🌀 Not understanding your own powers — the unknown within you feels like a storm you can’t yet name</button>
